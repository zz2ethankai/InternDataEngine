## 💻 About

InternDataEngine is a data-centric engine for embodied AI that powers large-scale model training and iteration.  
Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, it unifies high-fidelity physical interaction from InternData-A1, semantic task and scene generation from InternData-M1, and high-throughput scheduling from the Nimbus framework to deliver realistic, task-aligned, and massively scalable robotic manipulation data.

- **More realistic physical interaction**: Unified simulation of rigid, articulated, deformable, and fluid objects across single-arm, dual-arm, and humanoid robots, enabling long-horizon, skill-composed manipulation that better supports sim-to-real transfer.
- **More task-aligned data generation**: LLM-driven task and instruction generation with task-oriented scene graphs (ToSG), producing structured scenes and rich multi-modal annotations (boxes, keypoints, trajectories) for complex instruction-following and spatial reasoning.
- **More efficient large-scale production**: Nimbus-powered asynchronous pipelines that decouple planning, rendering, and storage, achieving 2–3× end-to-end throughput, cluster-level load balancing and fault tolerance for billion-scale data generation.

## 📢 Latest News 🔥
